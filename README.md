## Introduction
The Daily Tracker Application is a comprehensive tool that allows users to track their daily activities efficiently. Users can add subjects to keep track of their work and activities throughout the day. The app provides the flexibility to edit subject names and categorize them into different groups. Categories help users to organize and focus on specific sections of their activities. The application records the time spent on each subject in minutes. It offers a graphical representation of the data, enabling users to visualize their progress and patterns over time. The app includes five main pages in the navigation: Home Page, Subjects Page, Categories Page, Stats Page, and Mix Stats Page. Additionally, there is a separate page for detailed stats of a subject, where users can view and remove specific data entries.

## About the project
The Daily Tracker Application is designed to simplify and enhance daily activity tracking for users. It offers a user-friendly interface to record and monitor daily activities effectively. Users can create and manage subjects for tracking various activities. They can also customize subject names based on their preferences. The application allows users to organize subjects into categories to manage related activities better. For each subject, users can enter the time spent on that activity in minutes. The application then provides graphical representations of the data, allowing users to gain insights into their daily routines.

The application features five main pages accessible through the navigation menu:
1. Home Page: Serves as the central hub where users can add time entries for different subjects.
2. Subjects Page: Enables users to manage their subjects and change subject names as needed.
3. Categories Page: Users can create, edit, and organize subjects into different categories, facilitating better organization and analysis.
4. Stats Page: Displays graphical representations of data for each subject, allowing users to track their progress and trends over time. It provides a visual overview of how much time is spent on various activities.
5. Mix Stats Page: Offers a similar graphical representation, but it focuses on the data based on categories. This enables users to gain insights into the distribution of time across different activity categories.

The application employs WebSQL and Local Storage to efficiently manage and store user data on the client side. This ensures data security and privacy as no actual personal information is involved. Users can easily add, edit, and remove time entries, subjects, and categories within the application. They can also access the Full Stats Page for detailed information on a specific subject. This page provides a comprehensive view of all the data entered for that subject, enabling users to review their past activities.

The Daily Tracker Application is ideal for individuals seeking to enhance their productivity, manage their time effectively, and gain a better understanding of their daily routines. It encourages users to track their daily activities consistently and make informed decisions to optimize their schedules. The application does not involve actual gambling or monetary transactions; instead, it employs virtual coins as a fun way to represent tracking progress and achievements.
